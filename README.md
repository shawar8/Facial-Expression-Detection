The Dataset can be downloaded from https://www.kaggle.com/deadskull7/fer2013

# Running the Code
1) The code can be run as is. Make sure the dataset is present in the same folder as the facial_expressions.ipynb file.
2) If you want to run the pre-trained model, you do not need to run the model.fit() cell. Just run the model.load_weights('face_emotions.h5').
